## **Oh, no, you've reached the end of the book!**

I'm still writing it. **If you want to give me encouragement, a tip of any size to **[**my PayPal**](https://www.paypal.me/morinted)** will guarantee a new page within 48 hours!**

Please include a note on how you'd like to be attributed. On top of the new lesson, I'll put a name and link of your choice, or can keep you anonymous.

\(I reserve the right to veto any name or link I find inappropriate -- I want to keep the textbook family-friendly as best as possible. GitHub, Twitter, and personal websites should all be fine\)

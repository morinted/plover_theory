## **Oh, no, you've reached the end of the book!**

I'm still writing it. **If you want to give me encouragement, a tip of any size to **[**my PayPal**](https://www.paypal.me/morinted)** will guarantee a new page within 48 hours!**

Please include a note on how you'd like to be attributed. On top of the new lesson, I'll put a name and link of your choice, or can keep you anonymous.

\(I reserve the right to veto any name or link I find inappropriate -- I want to keep the textbook family-friendly as best as possible. GitHub, Twitter, and personal websites should all be fine\)

### Brainstorming

Complex endings/beginnings:

* -tion
* -rve
* -nk

* -lg, -lk

* -nch and "lunch"

* -st \(maybe just "F" as "-S"?\)

* Probably need a lesson to solidify:

* ble, kt, ng

Fingerspelling

* S-P and TK-LS need to be mentioned here, maybe arrow key movements too?

Shortening principles:

* -y words \(oh my goodness :O, this'll be big...\)
  * KWREU
  * SKWREU
  * REU, HREU, PWEU...
* -ie, -ey, -ee
* Reversal

From the top 100, this is left:

* like, time, just, its, first, most

Words beginning with:

* co, con, com
* o, on
* pre, pro
* re, de
* in, int, inter
* un, under

Advanced number usage, such as -Z, -D, clock times, Roman numerals?

Brief families:

* Months of the year, days of the week
* Units inch, feet, kilometers, kilograms etc.
* Phrases

I want to get Jeff to make illustrations, mainly to draw the exercise sentences. I want a wet rat to be hugged.

In the later lessons I think I'll move more into a format where I have one or two "letters" or stories as opposed to just the drilling sentences.
